1. Calibrate the Gas Sensors Used. Some of them include (MQ2, MQ5, and MQ4 gas sensors, LPG gas sensors, CO2, and Gas sensors).
2. Obtain measuremenet readings from every gas sensor each second (1 second) in ppm or ppb that the PePVEAT is enclosed with a container
   containing 1 L of the Petroleum Product, for which adulteration is to be detected. This is to be done for TWO (2) FULL MINUTES
   and this is known as the Gaseous Vapor Emission (GVE) Technique.
3. Analyze the results using pre-known data parameters to determine if the petroleum product is pure or adulterated.
